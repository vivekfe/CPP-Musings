new (memory_address) Type();

Where memory_address is a pointer to the memory location where the object should be created, and Type is the type of the object to be created. This can be a class, struct, or any other user-defined type.

This concept of using new operator to create an object at a specific memory location is called "placement new". It is used in situations where the programmer wants to have control over the exact location of the object in memory, usually for low-level memory management or for performance optimization.

It's worth noting that, the placement new is most commonly used in conjunction with memory pools or other memory allocation schemes that provide a specific memory location for an object. This is because direct use of placement new is not safe, it can cause undefined behavior, memory leaks, and other serious problems if not used correctly.

It's also worth noting that the memory provided to the placement new must be previously allocated and it's the responsibility of the developer to deallocate the memory after use with delete.

In most cases, it is better to use the standard new operator to dynamically allocate memory on the heap, as it is safer and more convenient.
  
  The form new (memory_address) Type; doesn't call the default constructor, it only creates an object at the specified memory location without initializing the member variables of the object. The form new (memory_address) Type(); calls the default constructor and initializes the member variables of the object to their default values.
